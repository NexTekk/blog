We are a team of passionate advanced IT technologists. Our combined experiences from different technological backgrounds give us immense abilities to conquer a lot of difficult IT challenges. We, as a team, constantly seek to fine tune our processes to make them work for our people in order to better meet the needs of our clients. We have taken offshoring to the next level. While most projects developed offshore fail woefully, we succeed brilliantly. That's solely because of the processes we have put in place to make projects go on smoothly while the team stays together regardless of geographical locations. How do we know our approach to solving offshoring issues work? Well, our 100 percent success rate speaks for itself.

Our core management and architectural teams live in the United States while the development team reside outside of the country. We work together as one global team to deliver compeling solutions for less than half the normal cost. Other people call us The Software Guys, we call ourselves NexTekk.
